As I start on a ruby assignment on learn.co platform. I scan through the steps they have provided in the readme, then try to understand the problem as a whole by stepping back while looking at the bigger picture from there I enter the IDE which is run on atom then run learn or rspec to see what my errors displayed. One by one I try to solve the errors and if I get stuck on an error I use the internet to help me solve the problem if that doesn’t work I’ll ask a Q/A  or slack community to help me solve that particular problem.

One final note I,ve noticed keeping a note pad and pencil next to you while your coding will help for time when you cant figure it out on your own. because reading it out loud after you've written it down helps.
